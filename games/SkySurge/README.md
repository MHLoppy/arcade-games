## Other notes

- Documentation from the original author can be found in `/docs/`, though it describes the game as though it were complete so could be thought of as more of a to-do list than a description of the current game.
- BUG: the game can run significantly faster while the player isn't shooting because the game's primary rendering loop is not correctly configured.
