# InnoFes 2024 showcase stuff

- `balls.cpp` and `gravity.cpp` are modified versions of code from Shaun Ratcliff (SplashKit website team).
- `raymarch_types.h`, `raymarch.cpp`, `gridmarch_types.h`, and `gridmarch.cpp` are modified versions of code from Oscar Harris (SplashKit advanced game dev team).
- `program.cpp` is an amalgam of the ray marching and grid-based ray marching demos that include automated movement while idle. Switch between the two modes using SPACE.
- Build three separate executables by explicitly targeting `balls.cpp`, `gravity.cpp`, and `program.cpp` (not `*.cpp`).
