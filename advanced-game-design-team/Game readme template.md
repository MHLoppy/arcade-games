# Repo Name

## Technical overview

- **Language:** C++ / C#
- **Current scope:** Low / Medium / High _[How much stuff does the project currently do? Is there lots of code covering many different game systems? Quantity of project files and their average length is a good guideline.]_
- **Code quality:** Poor / Fair / Good / Excellent _[Poor = does not meet minimum quality standards (should be rare!). Excellent = Not necessarily perfect, but very good - good enough that the program's implementations can be used as reference.]_
- **Gameplay implementation:** Incomplete / Complete _[Complete games may still have room for further expansion by adding new levels / mechanics etc, but have a complete start-to-finish gameplay loop implemented.]_

## Gameplay overview

[Note the number of supported players and describe the game's genre and core gameplay loop. Try to be succinct, describing only the **core** mechanics, not every single game mechanic.]

## Other

[Add concise, valuable information such as links to supporting programs like level editors, or additional documentation. Don't add verbose information here - save new documentation in `/docs/` and link to it if you have detailed information you want to pass on. Leave as "N/A" if there's nothing to add.]

## Screenshots

[Provide 1-3 screenshots of the game. These screenshots should capture the game's core gameplay - avoid adding screenshots of menu screens etc.]
